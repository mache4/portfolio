            <h3>I started with
                programming in 2018, when I first encountered C language. Later I started learning new things like Web Development
                and Mobile Development. After exploring the programming world, my interests shifted onto other fields.
                I got interested in Mechanics and Physics. I am currently studying Computer and Software Engineering while looking for a job.
